Workaround: 

- start IPv6
- connect to all IPv6 modules (?) 
- start navible



If IPv6 started and then Navible: 
	it works, and navible dosnt see the IPv6


If Navible started and then IPv6:
	we can connect to the IPv6 module, but we cannot ping it, it is still showing on Navible
and once we try to use it with Navible the IPv6 connection turns off
